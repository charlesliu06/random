# Fleetwood Mac (The Buckingham, McVie, Nicks Era)

Some of my thoughts on the first three Fleetwood Mac albums in the Buckingham, McVie, Nicks era.

### Fleetwood Mac (1975):

* Must-listen: **Rhiannon** (Nicks), **Landslide** (Nicks)
* Other favorites: **Over My Head** (McVie), **Say You Love Me** (McVie)
* Pretty good: **Crystal** (Nicks), **Blue Letter** (Curtis & Curtis)

Some of Stevie Nicks’s best songs are on this album. Christine McVie’s songs are also great but have a more pop rock feel compared to the other songs. I’m not the biggest fan of Lindsey Buckingham’s songs on this album. You should absolutely watch a live performance of [**Rhiannon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py3w5fttedA)—it’s when Stevie’s ability as a performer/vocalist shines.


### Rumours (1977):

I really think that you should just listen to this album the whole way through, and make sure it’s not missing **Silver Springs** which was not on the original album. Usually I don’t like to listen to albums straight through because there are songs I won’t like in the middle, but I actually really like every single song on this album (which is why I can’t really choose must-listens and favorites). The songs I listened to most at any point in time are **Silver Springs** (Nicks), **Songbird** (McVie), **I Don’t Want to Know** (Nicks), **Don’t Stop** (McVie), and **You Make Loving Fun** (McVie). **Go Your Own Way** (Buckingham) might be Fleetwood Mac’s most celebrated song. 

On a side note, I also love reading about the history of the Fleetwood Mac surrounding this album (there’s a lot happening internally in the band around this time). It also makes some of the songs feel more meaningful and poignant (watch the end of [this live performance of **Silver Springs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud2XKt2N8fs) to see how their history comes through in their music). 


### Tusk (1979):

* Must-listen: **Tusk** (Buckingham)
* Other favorites: **Beautiful Child** (Nicks), **Over and Over** (McVie), **Think About Me** (McVie)
* Pretty good: **Sara** (Nicks), **Storms** (Nicks), **That’s All for Everyone** (Buckingham), **Never Make Me Cry** (McVie), **Walk a Thin Line** (Buckingham)

This is a pretty interesting album, especially Buckingham’s songs. I think the genius of Tusk (the song) really comes out in the energy of the live performances (plus it showcases how good Buckingham is live), so check out [this live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrRVW-p8SJ8). Normally I would put **Beautiful Child** and **Over and Over** as must-listens, but I love **Tusk** enough to give it its own category on this album.
